# Holodeck B2B
Holodeck B2B is a standalone system-to-system messaging solution that supports the [OASIS ebMS3](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/core/ebms_core-3.0-spec.html) and the [AS4 Profile](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/profiles/AS4-profile/v1.0/AS4-profile-v1.0.html) Standards. Being Java based, it will run on most platforms.

It is designed with extensibility in mind providing an interface layer (see the [interfaces project](interfaces)) which you can use to add or replace default implemented functionality.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
The only requirement to run Holodeck B2B is that you have installed a Java run-time environment version 11 and that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the path where the JRE is installed.  
If you have multiple Java run-times installed on your system, it is recommended to set the `JAVA_HOME` variable inside the Holodeck B2B start script (`setenv.sh` on Linux/MacOS or `startServer.bat` on Windows).

### Getting started guide
To help you execute your first message exchange using Holodeck B2B, you will find a [step-by-step guide to setting up Holodeck B2B](http://holodeck-b2b.org/documentation/getting-started/) on the project website.

## Contributing
We are using the simplified Github workflow to accept modifications which means you should:
* create an issue related to the problem you want to fix or the function you want to add (good for traceability and cross-reference)
* fork the repository
* create a branch (optionally with the reference to the issue in the name)
* write your code, including comments 
* commit incrementally with readable and detailed commit messages
* run tests to check everything works on runtime
* update the changelog with a short description of the changes including a reference to the issues fixed
* submit a pull request _against the `next` branch_ of this repository

If your contribution is more than a patch, please contact us beforehand to discuss which branch you can best submit the pull request to.

### Submitting bugs
You can report issues directly on the [project Issue Tracker](https://github.com/holodeck-b2b/Holodeck-B2B/issues).
Please document the steps to reproduce your problem in as much detail as you can (if needed and possible include screenshots).
