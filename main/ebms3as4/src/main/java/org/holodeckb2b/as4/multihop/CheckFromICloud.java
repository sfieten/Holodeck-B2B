/**

 * determined by the actor/role set on the <code>eb:Messaging</code> element. If the <i>nextMSH</i> is targeted it is
 * assumed that the message was sent through the I-Cloud.
 * <p>All message units in the received message are updated to indicate whether they use multi-hop. In the current
 * version the <i>RoutingInput</i> from the message is not saved with the message units, so only multi-hop replies to
 * User Messages can be created. This however allows to support the AS4 Multi-hop profile which does not specify support
 * for signals on signals.
