1. Contents of this directory
=============================

This directory is used by the default Certificate Manager to store the Java
key store files that hold the certificates that are used for processing signed
and/or encrypted messages.

It contains three key stores:

1) "privatekeys.jks" holding the key pairs Holodeck B2B uses to sign sent
   messages and decrypt received messages.

2) "partnerkeys.jks" holding the public keys of trading partners. These are 
   used to encrypt messages sent to the partner or to identify the partner
   in case of a Pull Request or to find the certificate of a signature when
   it is not included in the message.

3) "trustedcerts.jks" holding trusted certificates used to the validate trust
   in certificates used to sign received messages. As these certificates are
   considered trusted they are not checked on validity. Therefore this key 
   store should only contain certificates of trusted Certificate Authorities.

The distribution package by default includes empty key stores, with simple
passwords: "secrets" for the private one, "nosecrets" for the public
one and "trusted" for the one with CA certificates. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to
change these passwords to safer ones, see below how to configure Holodeck B2B
for the new passwords.

NOTE: If you want the change the passwords for the default key stores you must
also change the password on the key store files by executing the following
command:
    keytool -storepasswd -keystore «path to keystore»


2. Configuring the Certificate Manager
======================================

The default Certificate Manager is configured in "certmanager_config.xml" 
found in the Holodeck B2B "conf" directory. Beside the locations and
passwords of the three key stores there are two additional configuration
parameters:

1) "PerformRevocationCheck" : configures whether the Certificate Manager 
   should perform an OCSP revocation check when validation trust in a 
   certificate. If the check cannot be executed the Certificate Manager
   reports this as a warning. The default value for
   this setting is "false".

2) "DirectTrustPartnerCertificates" : defines whether the Certificate
   Manager should treat the partner certificates as trust anchors. In 
   that case only the validity of the certificate is checked (including
   the revocation check if enabled).


3. Adding certificates and private keys
=======================================

Each certificate of a trading partner or private key that is added to a
key store is assigned an identifier, called the alias. This alias is used
in the P-Mode to identify the certificate / key that must be used for 
processing the message. It is RECOMMENDED to use descriptive aliases for 
easy identification.
Although the aliases of trusted certificate authorities' certificates (in
"trustedcerts.jks") are not used in the P-Modes it is still RECOMMENDED 
to use meaningful aliases for these too.

To add a X.509v3 certificate holding the public key of a trading
partner or trusted CA to the public or trusted key store use the following
command:

keytool -importcert \
        -keystore «location of the keystore» \
        -storepass «your keystore password» \
        -alias «alias for the cert in keystore» \
        -file «path to certificate file»

To add a PKCS#12 formatted certificate holding the private of a trading 
partner to the private key store use the following command:

keytool -importkeystore -srcstoretype PKCS12 \
        -srckeystore «path to certificate file» \
        -srcalias «the name of the certificate in the PKCS#12 file» \
        -srcstorepass «the password to access the PKCS#12 file» \
        -destkeystore «Holodeck B2B base dir»/repository/certs/privatekeys.jks \
        -deststorepass «your key store password» \
        -destalias «alias for cert in key store» \
        -destkeypass «the password to set on the new entry in the key store»

NOTE: Use the following command to list the certificates in the PKCS#12
file and show their names / aliases:
keytool -list -v -storetype pkcs12 -keystore «path to certificate file»

4. Examples
===========

The examples/certs directory contains three sample key stores which contain
the certificates that are used in the example P-Modes (contained in
examples/P-Modes). Their passwords are the same as the default key stores.
You can therefore just overwrite the default key stores with the example
key stores.

When using a key pair in a P-Mode the password is
"Example" + 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'E'
