    <!-- ==============================================================
    This worker is responsible for reading the P-Modes from file. It is
    part of the default implementation for P-Mode configuration that
    uses XML files to define the P-Modes with one file per P-Mode. For
    more information about configuring a P-Mode see the XSD that defines
    the P-Mode file (http://holodeck-b2b.org/schemas/2014/10/pmode).

    If you want to have a fixed set of P-Modes remove the interval
    attribute so the P-Modes are read only when Holodeck B2B is
    started. DO NOT de-activate this worker as it will prevent
    Holodeck B2B from starting correctly as P-Modes must be available
    to process messages!

    This worker is responsible for starting the message send process.
    Because the P-Modes need to be loaded before messages can be sent
    the start of the worker is delayed with 5 seconds to allow loading
    the P-Modes.
    NOTE that de-activating this worker will stop message sending!

    This worker is responsible for checking whether a user message
    must be retransmitted because there was no timely Receipt.
    Because the P-Modes need to be loaded before messages can be retried
    the start of the worker is delayed with 10 seconds to allow loading
    the P-Modes.

    De-activating this worker will stop the retransmission function
    and therefore kill the AS4 Reception Awareness feature.

    This worker is responsible for cleaning up information on old and
    processed messages, i.e. remove the meta-data information from the
    database and delete associated payloads from the file system.
    Through the optional "purgeAfterDays" parameter the number of days
    after which the message information should be removed can be set.
    If not specified 30 days is used as the default setting.

    <!-- ==============================================================
    This worker is the default method for submitting messages to
    Holodeck B2B. It reads all message meta data documents from the
    specified directory and creates the messages for sending. The
    actual send process is started by the sender worker defined above.

    It is RECOMMENDED to specify an absolute path to the directory to
    watch for meta data documents.

    The worker will look for all files with ".mmd" extension. After
    processing the extension will be changed to ".processed". If an
    error occurs an new file with the same name but ".error" extension
    will be written with information about the error.

    Because the P-Modes need to be loaded before messages can be
    submitted the start of the worker is delayed with 5 seconds to
    allow loading the P-Modes.

    monitoring of the Holodeck B2B as implemented in the default  
    User Interface. The worker has one optional parameter "port" that 
    can be used to specify the port number that should be used by the
    RMI Server. The default port is set to 1701.
