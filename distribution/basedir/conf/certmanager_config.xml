             Holodeck B2B Default Certificate Manager Configuration

This file configures the access to the keystores used by the default implementation
of the Certificate Manager to store the key pairs and certificates needed in the 
processing of the messages. It uses three  JKS keystores which contain the keys and 
certificates needed in specific actions:
* The key pairs used for signing and decrypting messages. Note that a key pair may need to 
  contain more than one certificate if a certificate chain needs to be included in a 
  signature.
* The trading partner certificates with public keys used for encryption of messages and 
  identification.
* Holding "trust anchors" used for trust validation of certificates used to sign messages. 
  Normally these are the certificates of trusted Certificate Authorities. 

The use of these three key stores is similar to earlier versions of Holodeck B2B, but as 
in version 4 the trading partner certificates are by default not used during trust 
validation like they were in earlier versions. In version 4.x a so-called "compatibility 
mode" was offered so it could handle the configuration of earlier version. Since it can 
be useful in a environment where the certificates of trading partner are trusted this mode 
has now been replaced by a new <i>direct trust</i> configuration setting in which case the 
trading partner certificates are handled like trust anchors, with the exception that they 
are checked for validity. 
<p>Another new feature of this Certificate Manager is the option to perform a revocation 
check using OCSP on certificates. This check is disabled by default for back-ward 
compatibility and can be enabled in the configuration. Note however that when enabled and 
used in an environment where certificates don't provide OCSP information this will result 
in a lot of <code>ISignatureVerifiedWithWarning</code> events as the revocation check 
could not be executed.
